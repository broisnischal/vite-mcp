# Changesets

Hello and welcome! This folder has been automatically generated by `@changesets/cli`, a build tool that works
with multi-package repos, or single-package repos to help you version and publish your code. You can
find the full documentation for it [in the repository](https://github.com/changesets/changesets/blob/main/docs/intro-to-changesets.md).

## What are changesets?

Changesets are individual files that live in this directory that describe a change you wish to make to a
package when you next release. They contain three parts:

1. **Version type** (major, minor, patch)
2. **Summary** of the change
3. **Details** of the change (optional)

## How to use changesets

### Adding a changeset

When you've made a change that you want to include in a release, run:

```bash
npm run changeset
```

This will guide you through creating a changeset file. The file will be created in `.changeset/` directory.

### What happens next?

1. **Commit your changeset** along with your code changes
2. **Push to GitHub** - The GitHub Action will create a PR with version bumps
3. **Review and merge the PR** - This will trigger the publish workflow

### Versioning

When you run `npm run version` (or when the GitHub Action runs it), changesets will:

- Update version numbers in `package.json`
- Generate/update `CHANGELOG.md`
- Remove used changeset files

### Publishing

When you run `npm run release` (or when the GitHub Action runs it), it will:

- Build the package
- Publish to npm
- Create a git tag

## Example Changeset

```markdown
---
"vite-mcp": patch
---

Fix issue with console adapter not capturing all messages
```

## Types of Changes

- **patch**: Bug fixes, small improvements (0.0.1 → 0.0.2)
- **minor**: New features, backward compatible (0.0.1 → 0.1.0)
- **major**: Breaking changes (0.0.1 → 1.0.0)
